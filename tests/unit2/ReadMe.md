[Prerequisites]:

Build the `zephyr/samples/helloworld` for `qemu_x86_64 board`. Because the test code needs the `autoconf.h` file generated by a build. So I leverage the helloworld sample.

The helloworld build folder is assumed to be `zephyr/build/hello_world_qemu_x86_64`

Please use `Ninja` as the CMake generator.



[To build]:

```
cd zephyr/tests/unit2
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -GNinja -Dzephyr_dir=<zephyr folder of this repo>
ninja
```

[To run]:

```
cd kernel/stack_test/
./stack_test
```

[Result]:

```

[==========] Running 2 test(s).
